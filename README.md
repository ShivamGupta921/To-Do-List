# To-Do List

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in C++. It allows users to add, view, modify, and remove tasks. The tasks are stored in a binary file and each task has a unique task number, a task description, and a completion status.

## Features

1. **Add Task**: Allows you to add a new task to the list.
2. **Show Tasks**: Displays all the tasks along with their status (completed or not completed).
3. **Manage Tasks**: Allows you to check/uncheck tasks to mark them as completed or not completed.
4. **Remove Tasks**: Allows you to remove specific tasks, remove all completed tasks, or clear the entire list.
5. **Exit**: Exits the application.

## Dependencies

- The application uses the `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<string.h>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<cstdio>`, and `<iomanip>` libraries.

## Compilation and Execution

### Compilation

To compile the application, use a C++ compiler such as `g++`:

```sh
g++ -o todo todo.cpp
```

### Execution

To run the compiled application:

```sh
./todo
```

## File Storage

- The tasks are stored in a binary file named `tasks.dat`.
- A temporary file `temp.dat` is used during the removal of tasks.

## Notes

- Make sure to have appropriate permissions to create, read, write, and delete files in the directory where the application is run.
- The application clears the console screen using `system("cls")`, which is platform-specific to Windows. If you're using a different operating system, replace it with the appropriate command (e.g., `system("clear")` for Unix-based systems).
